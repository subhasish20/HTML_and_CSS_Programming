        Engineered a real time fake news tracking system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. 
        Pre-processed the textual data including steamming and vectorization (TF-IDF) and implement machine learning algorithm to find best accuracy on new data.

        Collected data from medicals along with online resources and applied data preprocessing, EDA with data visualization and build a machine learning classification model that outperform the accuracy score of 92%. 
        Deployed it on internet that can highly helpful to the people to track the probability of effecting by diabetes
